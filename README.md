# Overview


The goal of this project was to increase my understanding and familiarity with the language of c++. I did not to work on something boring like a calculator so I decided that building a program to play the chrome dinosour game would be much more engaging. 

The program is meant to play the dinosour game on chrome. The point of the game is for the dinosour (you) to avoid randomly generated catcus and other dinosours. The way the game wors is you run the program and then open up the dinosour game. Because it scales you first place your cursor on the dinosours arm and then press a to show the program where to look for incoming obstacles.

The programm was devloped using Microsoft Visual Studio 

The program was devloped using only C++. The only library used was windows.h. This library allows the program to make calls on the windows API. In this case to specifically retrieve information from pixels that are displayed on the screen.
